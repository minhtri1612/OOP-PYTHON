## Summary
Affenstarke Zahlenbande requires players to use calculation to balance a palm tree with one elephant and four monkeys. The game can be played by two to four people. Two actions make up a move: moving the elephant (optional) and moving a monkey. There are two ways to move a monkey:
- Move a colored monkey to the corresponding number on a Monkey card of the same color.
- Move a colored monkey to the number that comes from adding or subtracting two identically colored monkey cards.

The monkey must be moved before the elephant may be moved. The players can choose which of the two Elephant cards with numbers on them to move, or they can opt not to move at all if the Elephant move is too dangerous. The elephant cannot migrate if a monkey has already taken up residence in the field.

The elephant must advance to the last numbers and arrive at the leaping mat in order to win the game. Your team loses the game if the elephant or a monkey falls from the palm tree!
